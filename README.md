# Automate Names

- Automate file and directory names with `python` using the built in `os` module.
- I changed the file names `.` replaced with `-` in the files_demo directory.
- If you want to change the directory names then you don't need to use the condition, `splitext()` method.
- This really saves time, while working with bulk files or directories.

## Precautions

- Make sure that you change the working directory in `os.chdir()` or may occur parmanent data loss.
