# Automate names.

- Automate file and directory names with `python` using the built in `os` module.
- Execute the `automate_parse.py` file from the command line and check the `files_demo` directory.
- I changed the file names `.` replaced with `-` in the files_demo directory.
- If you want to change the directory names then you don't need to use the condition, `splitext()` method.
- I use 2 spaces for the indentation, if this runs any error just use your code formatter to get properly indented.
- This really saves time, if you have to work with bulk files or directories.

## Precautions

- Make sure that you change the working directory in `os.chdir()` or may happen parmanent data loss.
